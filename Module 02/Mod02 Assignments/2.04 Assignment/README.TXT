------------------------------------------PMR-----------------------------------------------------
The project was pretty simple and repetitive as it was just going over very basic arithmetic functions

The mistake I made was that I kept forgetting to use int to declare the variable and just tried to input iNum1 but it would never work. I got the hang of it by the time I had to declare doubles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the future I'll remember to declare my variables
